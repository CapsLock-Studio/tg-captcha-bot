# Telegram Captcha Bot

Telegram bot that validates new users that enter supergroup. Validation works like a simple captcha. Bot written in Go (Golang).

This bot has been tested on several large supergroups (1000+ people) for a long time and has shown its effectiveness against spammers.

## How it works
0. Add a bot to your supergroup
1. Promote the bot for administrator privileges
2. A new user enters your supergroup
3. Bot restricts the user's ability to send messages
4. Bot shows a welcome message and a captcha button to the user
5. If the user doesn't press the button within 30 seconds then the user is banned by the bot
